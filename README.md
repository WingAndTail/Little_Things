# Little Things
All the nifty little projects I did that seemed worth saving.

## Python
* daysBetweenDates.py
  * Calculates the days that have passed between two dates.
* diceRoller_DnD.py
  * Rolls any number of dice with any number of sides and adds modifiers.
  * Generates a block of random numbers for creating DnD 5e characters.
* CalendarFacts.py
  * Generates random facts based on the XKDC comic [Calender Facts](https://xkcd.com/1930/).
